# ✍️ API Design ✍️

---

The API conforms to the user stories established so far. The system is currently capable of managing books and loans, so that, by means of calls, books and loans can be created for those books, for example.

Let's remember that the main functionality was to have an application that would allow the lending of books to users, so with the developed resources that function is already partially fulfilled (user management would be missing to complete the task completely).


The API endpoints are as follows:

A class diagram is shown below to show what the system currently looks like:
