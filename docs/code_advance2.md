Progress has been made in the development of the functionality of [Milestone 2](https://github.com/LuGuDu/BorrowBooks/milestone/3), so that it has been practically completed and can be considered finished. This milestone called for the realisation of the main function of the project, which is to enable the book lending service on the platform. 

To its satisfaction, the following content has been developed or improved in the project:



- [App.py](https://github.com/LuGuDu/BorrowBooks/blob/LuGuDu-milestone2/borrowbooksapp/app.py)
- Controllers:
  - [LoanController.py](https://github.com/LuGuDu/BorrowBooks/blob/LuGuDu-milestone2/borrowbooksapp/controllers/LoanController.py)
- Dao:
  - [LoanDAO.py](https://github.com/LuGuDu/BorrowBooks/blob/LuGuDu-milestone2/borrowbooksapp/dao/LoanDAO.py) 
- Model:
  - [Loan.py](https://github.com/LuGuDu/BorrowBooks/blob/LuGuDu-milestone2/borrowbooksapp/model/Loan.py)
- Tests:
  - [BookController_test.py](https://github.com/LuGuDu/BorrowBooks/blob/LuGuDu-milestone2/borrowbooksapp/testingAPI/tests/BookController_test.py)
  
  
The following is the class diagram of the development of this first iteration in which the management of the books has been achieved by means of a REST API:
